\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{In this section we propose a peak power reduction case study, in the Demand-Response problem formulation, to compare performance of DPCRT against mbCRT and show the quality of the DPCRT modeling. To this aim we use the DoE Commercial Reference Building (Doe CRB) simulated in EnergyPlus \cite{DeruFieldStuderEtAl2011} as the virtual test-bed building. In particular, we first  describe our test-bed and introduce the data we use, then we validate the quality of the DPCRT modeling on the power consumption prediction of DoE CRB, and finally we compare DPCRT and mbCRT on the peak power reduction problem.}

\subsection{Test-bed description}
DoE CRB is a large $12$ story office building consisting of $19$ zones with a total area of $500,000$ sq.ft. There are $2397$ people in the building during peak occupancy. During peak load conditions the building can consume up to $1.6$ MW of power. For the simulation of the DoE CRB building we use actual meteorological year data from Chicago for the years $2012$ and $2013$. The dataset we use for training the trees can be divided into $4$ different categories:
\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,0.00}{\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1cm]
	\item \textbf{Weather Data:} $w = [\mathrm{w}_1,\ldots,\mathrm{w}_d]$. These data include measurements of the outside dry-bulb and wet-bulb air temperature, relative humidity, and wind characteristics. Since we are interested in predicting the power consumption for a finite horizon, we include the weather forecast of the complete horizon in the training features.
	\item \textbf{Schedule Data:} $s = [\mathrm{s}_1,\ldots,\mathrm{s}_r]$. We create proxy variables which correlate with repeated patterns of electricity consumption, e.g. due to occupancy or equipment schedules. For example, Day of Week is a categorical predictor which takes values from $1$ to $7$ depending on the day of the week. This variable can capture any power consumption patterns which occur on specific days of the week. Likewise, Time of Day is quite an important predictor of power consumption as it can adequately capture daily patterns of occupancy, lighting and appliance use without directly measuring any one of them. Besides using proxy schedule predictors, actual building equipment schedules can also be used as training data for building the trees.
	\item \textbf{Building Data:} $b = [\mathrm{b}_1,\ldots,\mathrm{b}_m]$. These data include the states of the building, such as Chilled Water Supply Temperature, Hot Water Supply Temperature, Zone Air Temperature, Supply Air Temperature and Lighting levels.
	\item \textbf{Power Consumption:} $P$. This is the response variable, in addition to zone temperatures. 
\end{enumerate}
In order to predict the power consumption of the building for the entire length of the horizon, we use the notion of auto-regressive trees. An auto-regressive tree is a regular regression tree except that the lagged values of the response variable are also predictor variables for the regression tree, i.e. the tree structure is learned to provide the following model as in \eqref{eq:RTmodel}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:building_model}
P_t = f \left( w(t), s(t), b(t), P(t-1),\dots, P(t-\delta) \right).
\end{equation}
where $\delta$ is the order of the auto-regression and $P(t-j)$ is the value of the power measured at time $t-j$. This allows us to make finite horizon predictions of power consumption for the building.}

\subsection{DPCRT modeling validation}

\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,0.00}{We build, using \eqref{E:DPC_split_rule2}, multi-variate output regression trees using a training dataset from July $2012$. For a tree with order of auto-regression $\delta = 6$, a prediction horizon $N = 20$ and $\mathrm{Q}$ equal to the identity matrix, the results on the test dataset are shown in Fig. \ref{F:perf_test}. The test set shows a day from July 2013. In particular, we compare the building power consumption $P_t$ predicted at time $t$, with the actual power consumption of the building from the test dataset. Since we can predict the power for multiple steps of the horizon, we add to the comparison the power prediction at time $t$ computed at $t-10$ and $t-20$, i.e. $P_{t|t-10}$ and $P_{t|t-20}$ respectively. It can be seen that even with a relatively long horizon, the multi-variate output tree model captures the rapid changes in the response variable very accurately. Differently, DPCRT uses only a subset of features to train the tree, while the imputs are used to train models in the leaves. Thus the performance of DPCRT depend on $2$ key assumptions:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1cm]
	\item The separation of variables does not introduce significant errors while training the tree.
	\item The linear regression at the leaves is a valid assumption.
\end{itemize}
We verify the validity of these assumptions in terms of their effect on model accuracy considering the following $2$ cases:}

\textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,0.00}{\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1cm]
\item We train $2$ kinds of regression trees: $\mathcal{T}_1$, that is trained using all the features described above, and $\mathcal{T}_2$, that was learned from disturbance variables only, with a linear model on the control variables at the leaves as in \eqref{eq:train_model_multi}.
The predicted power consumption of the building at time $t$ and $t+5$, i.e. $P_t$ and $P_{t+5}$, for both trees is shown in Fig. \ref{F:separation_vars}. The Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) for these $2$ outputs on the test dataset is shown in Tab. \ref{T:NMRSE_separation_vars}. We notice a small loss in model accuracy with $\mathcal{T}_2$ due to the separation of variables. 
This is the opportunity cost to pay for integrating control synthesis with the tree, since otherwise the control features would have been a part of the splitting criteria rather than a linear model in the leaves of the tree.
\item For the tree $\mathcal{T}_2$, we fit a linear model on the sum of all outputs, i.e. the sum of power consumption over the complete control horizon. For each leaf $i$ we have
\begin{gather}
P_t+ \dots + P_{t+N}  = \beta_{0,i} + \beta_i^\top u.
\end{gather}
For $2$ randomly selected leaves, the fit of the linear model against the actual power consumption is shown in Fig. \ref{F:linear_approx2}. The error observed in the predicted and actual power consumption for all leaves is depicted in Fig. \ref{F:linear_approx}. It can be seen that for a small number of samples in the leaves of the tree the linear model assumption is valid.

\subsection{DPCRT for peak power reduction}

\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{The key to answering the question of what actions to take to achieve a significant DR curtailment upon receiving a notification, lies in making accurate predictions about the power consumption response of the building. In this context, we evaluate the performance of DPCRT for peak power reduction in buildings. This case study is chosen to reflect the advantages of receding horizon control with regression trees (DPCRT) with respect to the one-step lookahead control (mbCRT). As already described, the data samples consist of $4$ types of features, namely weather data, schedule data, building data and autoregressive terms of building power consumption. We use the following $3$ features from the building bata as control variables: Zone Temperature Cooling Set Point, $\mathrm{u}_c$ [$^{\circ}$C], Chilled Water Temperature Set Point, $\mathrm{u}_h$ [$^{\circ}$C], and Lighting Set Point, $\mathrm{u}_\ell$ (values from $0$ to $1$). Since the power consumption model also depends on zone temperatures, then to have a prediction of the power over the horizon we first need to predict zone temperatures. To this aim, the following models are built using \eqref{eq:train_model_multi}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1cm]
	\item $P_j^c$ - Power consumption model at time $j$ due to $\mathrm{u}_c$. Learned using all the features except for the inputs. Only $\mathrm{u}_c$ have been used to fit the linear model in the leaves.
	\item $P_j^h$ - Power consumption model at time $j$ due to $\mathrm{u}_h$. Learned using all the features except for the inputs. Only $\mathrm{u}_h$ have been used to fit the linear model in the leaves.
	\item $P_j^\ell$ - Power consumption model at time $j$ due to $\mathrm{u}_\ell$. Learned using all the features except for the inputs. Only $\mathrm{u}_\ell$ have been used to fit the linear model in the leaves.
	\item $T_{i,j}^c$ - Temperature model of the $i^{th}$ room at time $j$ due to $\mathrm{u}_c$. Learned using all the features except for the inputs and the room temperatures $r,\ \forall r\neq i$. Only $\mathrm{u}_c$ have been used to fit the linear model in the leaves.
	\item $T_{i,j}^h$ - Temperature model of the $i^{th}$ room at time $j$ due to $\mathrm{u}_h$. Learned using all the features except for the inputs and the room temperatures $r,\ \forall r\neq i$. Only $\mathrm{u}_h$ have been used to fit the linear model in the leaves.
	\item $T_{i,j}^\ell$ - Temperature model of the $i^{th}$ room at time $j$ due to $\mathrm{u}_\ell$. Learned using all the features except for the inputs and the room temperatures $r,\ \forall r\neq i$. Only $\mathrm{u}_\ell$ have been used to fit the linear model in the leaves.

At $t+1$ we repeat the algorithm with the updated measurements.} \textcolor[rgb]{1.00,0.00,0.00}{We consider the same formulation of \eqref{eq:DPCRTCaseStudy} for the mbCRT algorithm.}

We compare the two algorithms when simulated in closed-loop with the EnergyPlus mode of the building. In order to compare the performance of DPCRT, we consider a scenario in which there is a significant disturbance which is only anticipated $30$ min in advance and leads to a sudden increase in zone temperatures in the building. This maybe akin to a sunned spike in occupancy or equipment being switched ON at a brief notice. Under this scenario, it is important to react to the disturbance in a predictive manner in order to minimize the peak power consumption. This scenario is shown in Fig. \ref{F:scenario}. Between $15:30$ and $16:00$, an enormous spike in the power consumption ($1.5\times$) is expected because of a scheduled operation.

\captionsetup{justification=centering}
\end{figure}
The control strategies are tested over a $2$ hours duration between $15:00$ and $17:00$. Fig. \ref{F:res_control} shows $3$ control strategies: mbCRT, DPCRT and a Naive load reduction strategy. The naive strategy is equivalent to not responding to the disturbance at all. It maintains the desired zone temperature set point $\u_c$, chiller water temperature set point $\u_h$ and lighting level $\u_\ell$ throughout the test period. In Fig. \ref{F:res_power}, it can be seen that DPCRT reacts to the disturbance much before mbCRT, which waits until the last time-step before the disturbance to react. This leads to a significantly lower peak power consumption that mbCRT. In the case of DPCRT, the control horizon is $6$. At $15:00$, DPCRT strategy is same as the greedy one. At $15:05$, the downstream disturbance is visible to DPCRT algorithm and it starts to pre-cool the building by decreasing both cooling and chiller water set points. At $15:25$, the $\u_c$ and the $\u_h$ are reduced to minimum so that in the period of extreme disturbance an optimal trade-off between power consumption and thermal comfort is maintained. Thus, DPCRT algorithm foresees the disturbance and takes a preemptive action against it.  On the other hand, the mbCRT algorithm considers the power consumption and the zone temperatures of only one time step. Therefore, it does not know of an upcoming disturbance. At every time step, it chooses that $\u_c$, $\u_h$ and $\u_\ell$ which optimizes the cost for that time step. Naturally, this leads to a jaggy behavior in the control strategy. We can see a similar behavior for the power consumption in Fig. \ref{F:res_power}. The DPCRT algorithm gradually increases the power consumption because it can see the disturbance before it actually reaches $15:30$, while in the case of mbCRT, the power consumption overshoots by a big margin because the controller deals with the disturbance in a single step. DPCRT maintains zone temperature much closer to the reference temperature of $24^°C$ while both mbCRT and the naive strategy have large deviations from the desired temperature. 

The quantitative comparison is presented in Tab. \ref{T:case_quant}. Between $15:00$ and $17:00$, DPCRT and mbCRT result in similar energy usage, $5102$ kWh and $5097$ kWh, respectively, both outperforming the Naive strategy which incurs $5358$ kWh. Peak power in the case of DPCRT is $1.58$ MW which is lower than both mbCRT ($1.73$ MW) and the Naive strategy ($1.63$ MW), although Naive outperforms mbCRT. The peak power with DPCRT is $8.6\%$ less than mbCRT and $3.1\%$ less than the Naive. While both DPCRT and mbCRT account for thermal comfort, DPCRT deviates less from the desired temperature. The Naive strategy does not trade off on thermal comfort. Thus, DPCRT outperforms mbCRT both in terms of a reduced peak power consumption and better thermal comfort.
